            <h1>LETTER TO A WOMAN</h1> <br>
            <p style="word-wrap: break-word">
                Do you remember,<br>
                You all, of course, remember<br>
                How I stood<br>
                Approaching the wall<br>
                Excitedly you walked around the room<br>
                And something sharp<br>
                They threw it in my face.<br>
                You said:<br>
                It's time for us to part<br>
                What has tortured you<br>
                My crazy life<br>
                That it's time for you to get down to business,<br>
                And my lot is<br>
                Roll on, down.<br>
                Beloved!<br>
                You did not love me.<br>
                You did not know that in the crowd of people<br>
                I was like a horse driven in soap<br>
                Spurred by a bold rider.<br>
                You didn't know<br>
                I'm in solid smoke<br>
                In a life torn apart by a storm<br>
                That's why I'm tormented that I don't understand -<br>
                Where the rock of events takes us.<br>
                Face to face<br>
                You can't see the face.<br>
                Great things are seen at a distance.<br>
                When the sea surface is boiling<br>
                The ship is in a deplorable state.<br>
                Earth is a ship!<br>
                But someone suddenly<br>
                For a new life, new glory<br>
                Into the midst of storms and blizzards<br>
                He directed her majestically.<br>
                Well, which of us is big on deck<br>
                Didn't fall, vomit and curse?<br>
                There are few of them, with an experienced soul,<br>
                Who stayed strong in pitch.<br>
                Then I too<br>
                To the wild noise<br>
                But maturely knowing the work,<br>
                Descended into the ship's hold<br>
                So as not to watch human vomit.<br>
                That hold was -<br>
                Russian pub.<br>
                And I bent over a glass<br>
                So that, without suffering for anyone,<br>
                Ruin yourself<br>
                Drunk in a frenzy.<br>
                Beloved!<br>
                I tortured you<br>
                You had longing<br>
                In the eyes of the tired:<br>
                That I am on display before you<br>
                I wasted myself in scandals.<br>
                But you didn't know<br>
                What's in solid smoke<br>
                In a life torn apart by a storm<br>
                That's why I suffer<br>
                I don't understand<br>
                Where does the rock of events take us ...<br>

                Now the years have passed.<br>
                I'm at a different age.<br>
                And I feel and think differently.<br>
                And I speak over the holiday wine:<br>
                Praise and glory to the helmsman!<br>
                Today I<br>
                In the shock of tender feelings.<br>
                I remembered your sad weariness.<br>
                And now<br>
                I'm rushing to tell you<br>
                What i was<br>
                And what happened to me!<br>
                Beloved!<br>
                It's nice to say to me:<br>
                I escaped falling from the steep.<br>
                Now in the Soviet side<br>
                I am the fiercest fellow traveler.<br>
                I became not the one<br>
                Who was then.<br>
                I would not torment you<br>
                As it was before.<br>
                For the banner of liberty<br>
                And light labor<br>
                Ready to go even to the Channel.<br>
                Forgive me ...<br>
                I know: you are not that -<br>
                You live<br>
                With a serious, intelligent husband;<br>
                That you don't need our trouble,<br>
                And I myself will you<br>
                Not a bit needed.<br>
                Live like this<br>
                As the star leads you<br>
                Under the booth of a renewed canopy.<br>
                Greetings,<br>
                Remembering you always<br>
                Your friend<br>
                Sergey Yesenin.</p>

                It's ugly to be famous.<br>
                This is not what raises up.<br>

                Shake over the manuscripts.<br>

                The purpose of creativity is self-giving,<br>

                And shouldn't be a single slice<br>
                Don't give up on your face<br>
